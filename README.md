# ViewPagerWithCompose
Simple examples for ViewPager with Jetpack Compose.The ViewPagerCompose project demonstrates how to integrate a ViewPager-like component using Jetpack Compose to create a swipeable UI for paging between different content. 

In Jetpack Compose, the Pager component (specifically HorizontalPager) is part of the Accompanist Pager library, which allows developers to build swipeable views with a declarative, functional approach. The goal of this project is to use Jetpack Compose's Pager API to create an interactive and flexible UI that allows users to swipe horizontally through content.

Key Features of ViewPagerCompose:
Swipeable Pages: The primary feature is the ability to swipe between pages of content.
Declarative UI: Jetpack Compose's declarative nature allows us to define how the UI should look and behave, making it easier to manage complex UIs.
Dynamic Content: You can add dynamic content to each page (e.g., images, text, or lists) based on a data source.
Customization: You can easily customize the appearance of the Pager, such as the page size, transition animations, and indicators.
